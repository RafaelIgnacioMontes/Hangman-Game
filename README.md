#
# Getting Started

### - We will begin this project by designing the HTML with the basic elements needed with flex box 
### - After all elements of HTML have been added we will use CSS to make sure that everything looks the way its supposed to and to my liking
### - Make sure all HTML elements are in place and that all the CSS edits are properly done to reflect the hangman game. 
### - After this is done we will begin with Javascript.

#
# Game Functionality

### - Able to randomly generate a word (noun) to guess.
### - Has in game instructions on the page
### - Once you have guessed 5 times incorrectly game ends and you lose
### - Once game ends you are able to hit play again button to get a new word and restart the game
### - Maximum of 1 character per guess
### - When guessing correctly it substitutes a value in the line for the correct letter

#
# Still to come
### - Scoreboard that tracks your progress
