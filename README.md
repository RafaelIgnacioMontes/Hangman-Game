# Getting Started

### - We will begin this project by designing the HTML with the basic elements needed with flex box 
### - After all elements of HTML have been added we will use CSS to make sure that everything looks the way its supposed to and to my liking
### - Make sure all HTML elements are in place and that all the CSS edits are properly done to reflect the hangman game. 
### - After this is done we will begin with Javascript.
